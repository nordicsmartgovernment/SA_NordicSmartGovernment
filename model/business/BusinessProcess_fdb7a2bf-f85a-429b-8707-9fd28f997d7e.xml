    documentation="The process supports the generation of pick batches for releases that have been released to fulfillment but not yet included in a pick batch. Creation of a pick batch includes the creation of a pick slip, a pack slip for releases, and an invoice.

If an order contains backorder items or future order items, the inventory will be alllocated at the order processing sub-process."/>
